Today statistics is more important that ever, because of the ease with which we can collect large amounts of data. The challenge is to sort through all of this data and separate out the consistent patterns from the noise.\nHow best to use these tools is a fundamental challenge for our subject and the focus of my research.\nI complete my PhD in Mathematical Sciences from the University of Manchester. Before coming to Manchester, I did a MSc in Statistics and Probability at Center for Mathematical Research (CIMAT)\nPrior to this, I did a BSc in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://dapr12.github.io/author/diego-andres-perez-ruiz/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/diego-andres-perez-ruiz/","section":"authors","summary":"I am broadly interested in statistical theory and methodology with particular interest in functional data and nonparametric statistics.
